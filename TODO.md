## Bugs
- The value acts as the increment but also for the value
-  The increment does nothing


## Features
 - Ability to change app accent theme and light / dark mode - Almost completed
- Adaptive text to the counter colour
- More counter colours
- Add welcome screen
- On non demo version add ads
- Fix the numbers becoming larger than the view, either through restricting how high you can count or by cutting off the text
- Ability to enter negative numbers into set value box (add '-' to keyboard)
- Revamp the whole counter setting UI, use a static table view - Half done
