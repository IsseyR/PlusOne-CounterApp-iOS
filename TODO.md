# TODO

## Bugs
- The value field in the counter setting doesn't show the current counter value properly
- Update dark mode to not change some elements depending on system theme (iOS 13)
- The no items animation doesn't change colour unless refreshed


## Features
 - Ability to change app accent theme and light / dark mode - Almost completed
- Adaptive text to the counter colour
- More counter colours
- Add welcome screen
- On non demo version add ads
- Fix the numbers becoming larger than the view, either through restricting how high you can count or by cutting off the text
- Ability to enter negative numbers into set value box (add '-' to keyboard)
- Revamp the whole counter setting UI, use a static table view - Half done


## Possibilities
- The ability to have folders of counters
- To filter / search counters based on their attributes
- Revamped home screen
- More theming options
- Removed cap on counter value, shows scrolling number on home screen
